TODO list for libgpiod

==========

This document contains the list of things I'd like to have in libgpiod before
declaring it "mostly feature-complete". If anyone wants to help, this can
serve as the starting point.

==========

* implement dbus API for controlling GPIOs

A common complaint from users about gpioset is that the state of a line is not
retained once the program exits. While this is precisely the way linux
character devices work, it's understandable that most users will want some
centralized way of controlling GPIOs - similar to how sysfs worked.

One of the possible solutions is a DBus API. We need a daemon exposing chips
and lines as dbus objects and allowing to control and inspect lines using
dbus methods and monitor them using signals.

As of writing of this document some of the work has already been done and the
skeleton of the dbus daemon written in C using GLib has already been developed
and is partially functional.

----------

* implement a simple daemon for controlling GPIOs in C together with a client
  program

This is by far the lowest priority task. Similarly as with the dbus daemon:
the goal is to provide a centralized agent controlling GPIOs with a simple
interface consisting of a command line client communicating with the server
over unix sockets.

In this case however the goal is to have as few dependencies as possible. This
is because for some small systems dbus is overkill. Since we won't be using any
standardized protocol, it will take much more effort to implement it correctly.

----------

* re-write the python bindings to make them more 'pythonic'

There are several problems with the current python API. For instance: instead
of methods, properties should be used wherever possible (chip's name and label,
line's direction, active-state etc.), we should probably store the line objects
within the chip instead of creating them everytime get_line() is called and
several more.

The idea is to create a new Python module with a different name and convert
the current gpiod module into a compatiblity layer that would simply translate
the calls from the new interface to the old one - this way we won't break
existing programs.
